# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer

This is a personal project implementing 5 of the sorting algorithms covered in UCF's Computer Science 1 course. I built this program to get a better understand of object oriented programming, as well GUI programming. The Graphics package contains codes written to animate and visualize the algorithms, whereas the Logic package contains codes written for each algorithm.

## Compiling the Program
```
javac Main.java
```
## Executing the Program
```
java ./Main
```
