/**
 * This is a personal project implementing 5 of the sorting algorithms covered in UCF's Computer Science 1
 * course. I built this program to get a better understanding of object-oriented programming, as well as GUI
 * programing. The Graphic package contain codes written to animate and visualize the algorithm in a graphical
 * matter, and the Logic package contain codes written for each algorithm.
 *
 * <p><p><p>
 *
 * The first implementation of this visualizer features: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort,
 * and selection sort. I attend to add merge insertion sort in the near future, as well as more coloring to visualize
 * operations such as comparison during the sorting process.

 * @version 1.0
